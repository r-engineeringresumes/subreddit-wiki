Welcome to r/EngineeringResumes! 

This subreddit is dedicated to helping engineering students and professionals create and improve their resumes. Please note that the guidelines provided in this wiki predominantly align with the standards of resumes in the **United States and Canada**.

**Disclaimer:** there are no clear-cut rules when it comes to writing resumes, and this wiki serves as a resource offering general suggestions and guidelines rather than definitive rules.

---

## Introduction

**What is a resume?**

Your resume is essentially a 30-second elevator pitch on paper, encapsulating your contact information, education, experience, and background. Its purpose is to convince the hiring team to interview you.

Understanding your target audience is crucial. We wrote this wiki to describe what happens to your resume once it’s submitted, and [what the hiring process looks like from the employer’s perspective](https://thetechresume.com/samples/the-hiring-pipeline). The suggestions made in this wiki are made with this in mind, and we encourage applicants to be strategic with how they craft their resumes.

Ultimately, your resume can only do so much if you don’t have **genuine, relevant experience**.

For students, it's imperative to use your time in college wisely, engaging in meaningful activities such as projects, involvement in engineering teams, participation in research groups, and securing internships. These experiences significantly bolster the substance of your resume.

## General Rules

### Make your resume easy to read and skim

1. Use a single-column layout like <https://imgur.com/LC6AS8r>
2. Avoid icons, images, and graphics.
3. Don't indent your sections and bullet points. Using bullet points inherently creates indentation <https://imgur.com/qBJjbth>
4. Use bullet points, not paragraphs.
5. Use a modern, easy-to-read font like Calibri, Lato, or Charter.
6. Use a black (not thin) font with at least 11+ font size.
7. Don't [justify your text](https://uit.stanford.edu/accessibility/concepts/typography#justifyText) since it creates inconsistent spacing between words <https://imgur.com/6eKsENw>
8. Ensure you have enough white space (no cramming, and use sufficient margins (minimum 0.5") and line spacing (minimum 1.07)
9. Avoid excessive *italicization*, **bolding**, and ALL CAPS. If you do use one, use it independently of each other. 
10. Have clear section separation. The reader should be able to easily distinguish sections from others.
11. One page long, unless you have some 10+ years of experience. The rule of thumb is 1 page per decade of experience.
12. Separate your skills using **commas** <https://imgur.com/wzvRAfB>

### Make your resume more effective

We will dive deeper into this later in the wiki, but generally:

1. Include relevant and technical details to showcase your qualifications and distinguish yourself from other candidates. We will mention the [STAR/CAR/XYZ bullet point methods later in the wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/EngineeringResumes/wiki/index/#wiki_each_bullet_point_should_follow_star_or_xyz).
2. Provide context and incorporate relevant keywords. This helps the hiring team understand and relate to your work and technical achievements.
3. Avoid adding unnecessary information that doesn’t add to your candidacy.
4. Bring your critical and pertinent details to the top and the left of the resume. This increases the odds of these details being read by the hiring team.

As stated earlier, a resume functions as a 30-second elevator pitch on paper. Therefore, it needs to be succinct, easy to follow, yet informative for it to be effective. Following the rules above will:
 
1. Make your resume less distracting so the reader can easily locate and focus on the important details.
2. Increase the amount of white space available so you can include more content that improves your candidacy.
3. Prevent your resume from being a wall of text that makes it hard to read.

### Keep it to 1 page 

A common question we get is why we don’t recommend having multiple pages. Here’s why: 

* The majority of resumes that are posted on this sub don't need a second page. Once it gets cleaned up (content and format), a lot of people will have trouble populating 1 page with relevant, technical content.
* A multi-page resume that is poorly formatted and filled with irrelevant information doesn’t give a good impression to the hiring team.
* The hiring team is going to spend far less effort on reading longer resumes.

As we keep stressing, the goal is to make your resume as easy to read as possible. If you’re having trouble doing this with 1 page, consider removing content that is less relevant to the role you’re applying to, even if it’s technical. You can add this to your portfolio instead.

If you decide to go with a second page, you should be in the position to at least be considered for a **senior/staff role**. These candidates will likely have enough relevant experience to justify a second page (or even more).

## Formatting

Your resume should be:

1. Easily _skimmable_ by recruiters, hiring managers, and interviewers
2. Easily _parsable_ by an Application Tracking System (ATS)

### [Recommended Templates](https://www.reddit.com/r/EngineeringResumes/wiki/resumetemplates)

/r/EngineeringResumes/wiki/resumetemplates

* [Google Docs](https://www.reddit.com/r/EngineeringResumes/wiki/resumetemplates/#wiki_google_docs) <https://imgur.com/TraV3Qn>
* [LaTeX](https://www.reddit.com/r/EngineeringResumes/wiki/resumetemplates/#wiki_latex) <https://imgur.com/LC6AS8r>

---

### [Accessibility](https://uit.stanford.edu/accessibility/concepts/typography)

* Use a modern, [easy-to-read](https://uit.stanford.edu/accessibility/concepts/typography#readableFonts) font like Calibri, Charter, Arial, Lato, or Helvetica.
* Don't use grey-colored fonts since they're hard to read. Stick to black. Make sure to use a color that is printable in grey-scale. Be careful about using fonts that are too thin. Verify there is sufficient contrast with a white background.
* [Don't justify text](https://uit.stanford.edu/accessibility/concepts/typography#justifyText) since it causes inconsistent spacing between words. <https://imgur.com/6eKsENw>
* Don't italicize text since it can decrease the readability of your resume.
* Don't bold keywords within your bullet points, it's distracting.
* Italicization and bolding are only to be used if used _sparingly_. Excessive italicization and bolding decrease readability and ultimately contradict their purpose: **emphasis**.
* _Italicization_, ALL-CAPS, and **bolding**, if used, should be used independently of each other.
* Don't indent sections and bullet points. There's already indentation since the bullets themselves create an indent.
* Separate your sections clearly for optimal readability and visual clarity
  * Ensure there is sufficient and consistent white space between sections/subsections
  * Ensure there is sufficient and consistent white space between each job/project
  * Ensure there are sufficient vertical and horizontal margins (minimum 0.5 inches) <https://imgur.com/LC6AS8r>

---

### Dates

* If currently working at a job or on a project, use the word **Present** instead of ~~**Current**, **Now**~~, or ~~**Ongoing**~~
* If you choose to include months in addition to years, strictly use them and don't mix in ~~seasons~~ or ~~semesters~~ i.e. **March 2022**, not ~~Winter 2022~~
* Specific days of the year are unnecessary i.e. **January ~~1~~, 2023**
* Don't abbreviate years, i.e. **'23**. Denote the full year: **2023**
* Don't abbreviate months using digits, i.e. **9/2013**
  * If you choose to abbreviate your months, [follow the proper standard](https://web.library.yale.edu/cataloging/months)
  * Jan, Feb, Mar, Apr, May, **June**, **July**, Aug, **Sept**, Oct, Nov, Dec
  * Don't use periods when abbreviating months since they're unnecessary, i.e. **Sept** not **Sept.**
* For date ranges, use en dashes (–), not hyphens (-) or the word "to"
* Ensure there is a blank space before and after your en dashes i.e. **Mar 2012 – Mar 2022**, not **Mar 2012–Mar 2022**
* [Right align your dates to the right margin:](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://webapps.stackexchange.com/questions/51121/how-do-you-left-align-and-right-align-items-on-the-same-line-in-a-google-documen&sa=D&source=docs&ust=1704054021378265&usg=AOvVaw12Cc4WkVvDQM0Lz6rdHRwc) <https://imgur.com/87E2vkp>
* Your bullet points should not go further right than your dates <https://imgur.com/t1ZcrYR>

## Section Order

In general,

* [Once you've graduated from school and have started a full-time job](https://thetechresume.com/samples/resume-structure):
  * _Work Experience > Skills > Education_, or
  * _Skills > Work Experience > Education_
* If you're a student/new grad without much work experience:
  * _Education > Work Experience > Skills_, or
  * _Education > Work Experience > Projects (if you don't have sufficient work experience) > Skills_
* If you don't have any technical work experience:
  * _Education > Projects > Work Experience > Skills_
* If you don't have any work experience at all:
  * _Education > Projects > Volunteer Experience/Extracurriculars > Skills_

* Do **not** include a summary/profile unless you're a senior/staff engineer or above, making a career change, or addressing an unemployment gap/returning to the workforce
* Do **not** include a references section

---

## Contact Information

* **If you have a security clearance, it can be listed in the contact information section at the top of your resume near your name.**
  * Example: "Top Secret / SCI eligible with CI Polygraph"
* **If you have a foreign sounding name, or your education/work experience doesn't make it clear you're able to work in said country you're applying to, consider listing your citizenship/work visa status near your name to be explicitly clear to the recruiter/hiring manager that you don't require visa sponsorship.**
  * Example: "US Citizen", "US Permanent Resident", "Canadian Citizen", "Italian Citizen"
* Don't include your physical address and ZIP code
* Don't include your location (city, ST) unless the specific job you're applying for is in that specific city
  * Including a non-local location may cause implicit bias against you
* LinkedIn profiles are unnecessary
  * Chances are, nobody will ever click on your LinkedIn. If they want to find you on LinkedIn, they can simply search your name on LinkedIn or just Google you.
* Phone numbers are unnecessary
  * Interview processes these days don't begin with a cold call, the recruiter will email you for your phone number if they need it. Like location, a non-local area code may cause implicit bias against you
  * If you decide to list your phone number, don't preface your phone number with "Phone: ", "Cell: ", or "Mobile: "
  * If based in the US/Canada, omit the country code ~~+1~~, it's implied
* List only **1** email address
  * Use a modern email provider such as Gmail/Outlook, NOT AOL/Hotmail/Yahoo due to implicit bias against you
  * If you've already graduated, do not use a college email **unless** you went to a really prestigious school like MIT/CMU
* Don’t include a link to your GitHub profile if it’s empty
* Don't mask your email address, GitHub profile, and portfolio website i.e. [email](name@gmail.com), [github](github.com/username), [portfolio](myportfolio.com)
* Write out your email address, GitHub profile, and portfolio website in plain text i.e.
  * name@gmail.com
  * github.com/username
  * myportfolio.com
* Don't preface your email address with "Email: ". Simply display your email address i.e. name@gmail.com
* Don't preface your GitHub URL with "GitHub: ". Simply display 'github.com/username'
* Don't preface your personal website or portfolio URL with "Portfolio: ". Simply write out myportfolio.com for example
* Don't include https://www. for your URLs
* Don't underline, italicize, or color your email address/GitHub URL/portfolio URL/personal website URLs

---

## Work Experience

This section should be named _Work Experience_ or simply _Experience_ not ~~"Professional Experience", "Selected Experience", "Employment History", "Employment" or "Job History"~~

* Only include **PAID** work experience in this section (research experience can go here as well)
* Clearly indicate internships are internships and contract positions are contract positions
* Order positions and bullet points by relevancy to the job you’re interested in OR impressiveness: put your best stuff first!
* **Tailor your resume** for each application so it addresses the job description. Show that you can do the job
* **Add context**. Simply listing positions/projects and adding industry buzzwords is not enough. You need to tell hiring managers what you did and how you solved problems.
* **Differentiate yourself and don't be humble.** Simply listing job duties will not make your resume any different from others: [your resume is not your job description.](https://www.ag1source.com/2020/09/17/your-resume-is-not-your-job-description/). Tell us about your accomplishments, tangible metrics, and technical victories.
* **Avoid centering your skills around a piece of software if you can**. Any idiot can learn how to sketch, extrude, cut, and mate in SolidWorks - but identifying capabilities gaps (a need), creating a preliminary design, and taking it through the rest of the design process is something that fewer people can do, so try to focus on the engineering skills behind it. CAD and other software should be an “oh by the way” if possible.
* **Protip:** Engineers love it if you did hand-calc sanity checks instead of just hitting the RUN button in your FEA/CFD package, so do that and mention it at the interview. Seriously.
* Use bullet points, not paragraphs

If you're just graduating, focus more on showing a mastery of fundamental engineering skills first, then worry about the project management/leadership stuff if there is room left.

Not only are management & leadership very different in the real world, but no department in their right mind will have a new grad run a department or project or anything more complex than picking up lunch for the team. They are looking for someone who can master basic engineering tasks in this specific discipline and can hold a basic conversation. Show them you can do that first, and then think about running the show down the line.

### Bullet Points

#### Objectives  
1. Highlight the technical work you did
2. Highlight technical challenges you faced and overcame
3. Highlight the impact of your work

---

#### General Rules

* Bullet points should be 1-2 lines long. Use [Quillbot](https://quillbot.com/) and [LanguageTool](https://languagetool.org/paraphrasing-tool) to help you [paraphrase and shorten your bullets](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvPaEsuz-tY)
* Aim for **1** sentence per bullet
* Bullet points should be ordered from most relevant/impressive to least, as some hiring managers only have time to read the first they should get [THE BEST](https://media.giphy.com/media/VdVL5miirhFANoyPBM/giphy.gif)!
* Don't use [personal pronouns](https://www.grammarly.com/blog/personal-pronouns/) i.e. _I, we, us, my, our, their_
* Don't end bullet points with periods. Bullet points != sentences
* Your bullet points shouldn't go further right than your dates
* Don't spill bullets onto the following line with only 1–4 words on it. It's an extreme waste of space. For example <https://imgur.com/QCcZ792>
* Don't allow words to wrap to the next line and get hyphenated
* Avoid the excess use of **sub-bullet points**
  * They can clutter your resume, making it more verbose and harder to read
* Avoid using apostrophes **'**, ampersands **&**, and slashes **/**
* [Avoid the excessive use of adjectives and adverbs](https://resumeworded.com/resume-adverbs-key-advice), they're superfluous
  * B-adjectives: ~~excellent, innovative, expert, revolutionary, disruptive~~
  * B-adverbs: ~~creatively, diligently, meticulously, strategically, successfully, independently, innovatively, excellently, expertly~~
* Use digits instead of spelling out numbers: **8** ~~**eight**~~

---

#### Action Verbs

* Each bullet should begin with a **strong, past-tense action verb**<https://www.engineering.cornell.edu/sites/default/files/users/user240/Action%20Words%20for%20ENG%20(website).pdf>  
* **Led** is the past tense of **lead**
* **Good examples:** analyzed, architected, automated, built, created, decreased, designed, developed, implemented, improved, optimized, published, reduced, refactored
* **Bad examples:**
  * aided, assisted, coded, collaborated, communicated, executed, exposed to, gained experience, helped, participated, programmed, ran, used, utilized, worked on
  * [Don't use the verb **utilize**. 9/10 times that word will be attached to some disgusting Gordian knot of a sentence that says in 20 words what could be said in 10.](https://scientistseessquirrel.wordpress.com/2019/04/16/for-the-love-of-all-that-is-holy-stop-writing-utilize/)
  * **superfluous/awkward/unnecessarily complex verbs:** amplified, conceptualized, crafted, elevated, employed, engaged, engineered, enhanced, ensured, fostered, headed, honed, innovated, mastered, orchestrated, perfected, pioneered, revolutionized, spearheaded, transformed
  * **frequently misused verbs:** [leverage](https://www.steverrobbins.com/articles/leverage/), [enhance](https://english.stackexchange.com/questions/105465/what-differences-are-there-between-to-enhance-and-to-improve), [utilize](https://scientistseessquirrel.wordpress.com/2019/04/23/limited-use-cases-for-utilize/)

---

#### Each bullet point should follow STAR, XYZ, or CAR

**STAR:** **S**ituation, **T**ask, **A**ction, and **R**esults

* <https://www.levels.fyi/blog/applying-star-method-resumes.html>
* <https://resumegenius.com/blog/resume-help/star-method-resume>

**XYZ:** Accomplished **[X]** as measured by **[Y]**, by doing **[Z]**

* <https://www.inc.com/bill-murphy-jr/google-recruiters-say-these-5-resume-tips-including-x-y-z-formula-will-improve-your-odds-of-getting-hired-at-google.html>

**CAR:** **C**hallenge **A**ction **R**esult

* <https://ca.indeed.com/career-advice/resumes-cover-letters/challenge-action-result-resume>
* <https://www.topresume.com/career-advice/how-to-get-more-results-with-a-car-resume>

* If you're able to quantify your achievements/results, move the metrics towards the start of each bullet

#### Having trouble coming up with content for your bullet points? Ask yourself the following questions:

**What did I do?** 
 
* Did I solve a problem?
* Did I work on a team or work independently?
* How many people were on my team?

**How did I do it?**  

* Why did I do it / why did I do it that specific way?
* Did I use any tools or resources to help me? This could be software like MATLAB or SolidWorks, certain reference material like ASME 14.5, etc.
* Did I do any testing to validate my design choices? How did that testing impact my final design?

**What were the results of my actions?**   

* Did I deliver my project on time or under budget?
* Was I successful with the design/solution/project? Did it actually work the way I wanted it to?
* What went wrong? Did I learn anything from the experience?

---

#### Got Writer's Block from Looking at STAR/CAR/XYZ?

Here’s a fun exercise I learned from my last supervisor. At the start of every project, you and/or a task lead likely sat down and established the goals you had to meet, right? Ideally, these goals were set up in such a way that you could meet them and solid enough that you had to exert effort to make them happen.

Now that it’s time to write it up on your resume, start thinking back to what you did back then. Obviously, you met this goal - bold of you to put a failure on your resume - so look at how you met the goal. Did you deliver all five widgets in the agreed-upon six months? Did they have the ability to complete operations X, Y, and Z? Good!

Here’s the fun part. Did you exceed the goals in any way? If you did, how so? Did your delivered widgets reach the customer in half the time and do twice the operations in half the time? If you can flesh this out, you're in a good place.

Don't worry about writing at length. This is a planning exercise. Just get it all on paper and pick your brain until you think everything is on there. Even if you’re not 100% sure about exceeding a goal, just write it down.

When you're finally satisfied, start paring it down to meet space & content requirements.

---

#### Why Integration Matters

Don't throw a parts list at the reader. It matters less what specific components and subcomponents you used and more how you integrated all this into whatever your project was aiming to accomplish.

I'm not saying "yeah I made a machine that did task X" is sufficient, but just telling the reader your widget uses a Raspberry Pi and a stepper motor to do task X isn't helpful either.

How did your software interface with the stepper motors to complete task X to a desired level of precision? That's the kind of stuff that stands out and shows the reader your technical abilities.

---

#### Handling Sensitive Content (or u/graytotoro’s Suggestions on How to Not Get Fired And/Or Sued)

You’ve finally decided to move on from that job working on the X-02S Strike Wyvern on behalf of the Erusean Air and Space Agency. In your time on this project, you supported integration efforts for subsystems enabling this airplane to do things the likes of which would make other nations cower in fear.

But how do you talk about that on your resume without revealing information that would make you persona non grata from a particular industry or the recipient of an expensive-looking letter from a legal firm?

The answer: talk about the technologies behind it without saying the forbidden words. Choose your words very very carefully.

Instead of saying “I developed C++ software for testing LANTIRN display pod software used on the F-14D Tomcat”, consider “I developed C++ software for evaluating aircraft subsystems on [some hardware standard]-based test bench” OR “I created a proof-of-concept integrating COTS whatever items into a data recorder” - you shed just enough light on the subject without resorting to a vague “I did some stuff for these guys”. Of course, it goes without saying that you should still use the STAR criteria to flesh it out as necessary.

For a little less silly example, I once worked at a company that made carbon fiber widgets for airplanes. It was very obviously carbon fiber and even an idiot like me could tell, but we couldn't go around revealing our exact layups and procedures. Saying "a new standard process used to form composite parts, reducing lead times by 33% and (whatever other metrics)" would not be revealing anything too much. If they pry deeper, that's when you can say "no".

\*Not a lawyer (shh) so I can’t help you if you get into a Tom Clancy situation.

\*\*I didn’t actually do this, it’s an example. Sure would be cool though.

---

## Education

* Do **not** include coursework unless the courses are **extremely specialized** or **really cool** like Underwater Autonomous Robotics
* Don't include your high school
* Don't include schools from which you did not receive a degree
* Don't include your start dates, only your graduation date. Don't include a date range
  * If currently a student: **Expected May 2025**
  * If graduated: **May 2021** or simply **2021**
* This section should be in reverse chronological order. i.e. your master's degree goes above your bachelor's degree
* GPA
  * Generally, if your GPA is above 3.75, put it on your resume
  * 2 decimal places is sufficient, 3 is overkill
  * Once you start your first full-time job and your education section is moved to the bottom of your resume, remove your GPA unless it's very impressive
* On your resume, it's **Bachelor ~~'s~~ of Science** and **Master ~~'s~~ of Science**
* Don't include your school location if your school has the location in its name i.e. MIT or UCLA or if its location is commonly known
* Don't include awards/scholarships unless they're extremely impressive, i.e. Rhodes Scholar, Fulbright Scholar
* Include D1/competitive sports

## Skills 

shoutout to u/0ffkilter

### Objective  

The purpose of the skills section is to highlight in a few words what technical skills you can bring to the job.  Ideally, these match the job description.  They can also include other technical skills that are related, but perhaps not necessarily in the job description.  If you are applying to a job that's in Java, saying you also know C++ can be useful.  This is not a section to spew every buzzword on every technology you've ever touched.  Find a balance between enough skills (to show you can [wear many hats](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/wear%20many%20hats)) while not showing too many so that the reader makes it seem like none of them are important.  

This section should simply be named **Skills**, not ~~"Technical Skills", "Relevant Skills”, etc~~


#### You Should:

* Include languages you've used thoroughly and could theoretically interview in.
* Include technologies (frameworks, tools, and programs) that you've used previously.
* Repeat things that you use in your bullet points.  If you have Java in your skills, your bullet points in job descriptions should include Java, and vice versa.

#### You Should Not:

* Include soft skills  - don't include things like "teamwork", "leadership", and the like.  Demonstrate via your bullet points and descriptions that you've done these things, not just by listing them out.
* Include skills that are taken for granted and are assumed (typing, Microsoft Word, IDEs, etc - some of these are fine for other types of jobs, but are generally not useful for engineering)
   * Generally speaking, do not include:
      * Code Repository Websites (the skill itself is fine - use "Git" or "SVN", not "GitHub" or "Bitbucket" or "GitLab"
      * Operating Systems
      * IDEs or other word editors (VS Code, LaTeX, vim, etc)

### Formatting:

Your formatting should be easy to read, easy to digest, and convey what's important and what's simply "there".  Each skill should listed should feel important, and not like fluff.

#### You Should:

* Use 3 lines or less, in a single column format.
* Order your skills from most important to least important.
  * Consider whether the ones at the end should even be there
* Separate your skills into relevant categories such as **Software, Mechanical Design, Simulation and Analysis, Manufacturing, Lab Equipment, Languages, Technologies, or Design Tools**

* Use proper formatting:
  * Separate using properly punctuated commas, and not hyphens, dashes, pipes, or anything else.
  * Capitalize each of the skills properly, and if it has a proper name be sure to use that.
      * Solid**W**orks, C**ATIA V**5, LabV**IEW**, [etc..](https://www.reddit.com/r/EngineeringResumes/wiki/typo)
  * Separate similar skills if they are functionally different - 
     * Use "C, C++" not "C/C++".  Each skill should be separate, if necessary.  [see more here](https://www.reddit.com/r/EngineeringResumes/wiki/typo)

#### You Should Not:

* Bold random words or use unnecessary formatting.  The _only_ necessary formatting is if the name of the skill is expressly formatted in a way.
* Use any descriptor when describing your skills.  Do not say "Expert in _ " or "Professional in _".  List the _skill_ only, and use your bullet points to demonstrate your professional abilities.
* Use multiple columns.  One line, one column per group.  Listing skills vertically takes up too much space.  The highlight of your resume is in the words, and your skill bullet points are only here to get the point across and to be a reference of sorts.  


### Should I: 

#### Should I include random hobbies and other things?

* No.  You may hear about the stories where the interviewer and interviewee share a hobby or passion project on the side unrelated to the job.  That may work every now and then, and it is _acceptable_ (sometimes) to put these on your resume, but the skills section is not the correct area.  You should include that in a subsection, and only if there is nothing better to put on your resume.  

#### Should I include skills that I'm not super comfortable with, if I'm new to the industry?

* This is a judgement call.  An inexperienced engineer that lists a few skills they've really honed in on can often look better than a new engineer with 10+ skills they've clearly never used in industry.  Find a balance, and try to differentiate what you've used and are experienced with in, and what you've just "touched".

---

## Projects

This section should be named **Projects**, not ~~Academic/Engineering/Notable/Personal/Relevant/Selected/Technical Projects~~

* This section is for personal projects, student design teams, and extracurricular/hobbyist projects, **not** projects from work
* Don't use the word "project" in your project titles, it's redundant
* [Capitalize your project titles correctly](https://capitalizemytitle.com/) <https://capitalizemytitle.com/>
* For personal projects, roles/positions/locations/dates are generally unnecessary. What's more important is including a link to a portfolio page and/or GitHub repo
* There's no need to disclose "Personal Project", "Academic Project", or "Group Project" beside your project title
* Each project should consist of bullet points, ~~not paragraphs~~
* Order projects and bullet points based on relevance to the specific job and general impressiveness. Put your best stuff first and grab the reader's attention!

If you want your projects to stand out, they should be real projects, not mandatory school projects or trivial tutorial projects found online. Something that someone uses to solve a problem. Something that has users (can be just you, as long as you use it often) and is actively maintained and isn't just rotting in a GitHub repo, never to see a PR for the rest of its life. You can always join student clubs like SAE/AIAA competitive teams, and rocketry teams, or even be a mentor for an FRC/FTC team.

## Portfolios

Include links to GitHub profiles and portfolio websites only if they are up-to-date. If your pinned repositories lack READMEs or if your portfolio hasn't been updated in a significant time frame, it's advisable to save space and omit them from your resume. Contrary to common belief, these links are not obligatory, especially when their contents do not contribute meaningful value to your application.

* Only publish projects with good READMEs on GitHub. Aim for each README to have a good summary, screenshots, details on how to run, and **how to test**.
  * Include tests for your project that can be run. Have automated tests such as unit tests or end-to-end tests.
  * Take inspiration from projects with awesome READMEs <https://github.com/matiassingers/awesome-readme>
* [The Portfolio Handbook](https://evaeducation.weebly.com/uploads/1/9/6/9/19692577/portfoliohandbook.pdf) is an excellent guide to creating portfolios. Note that this guide was written for industrial design students
* Don't include full URLs for links
  * ~~<https://www>.~~ github.com/bob
  * ~~<https://www>.~~ portfolio.com

## Senior Engineers and Above (10+ YoE)

* Consider including a brief summary (<2 sentences)
* Have separate resumes for management and IC positions
* Try not to go over 2 pages
* Mention “soft” achievements on top of the business results
* Mention not only your impact but also your influence
* Make your earlier work experiences more concise
* Move your education section to the bottom of your resume

---

## Career Changers

* Include a brief summary (2 sentences) explaining that you’ve changed careers and your motivation. It’s helpful for recruiters and hiring managers to have the context that they’re reading the resume of someone who has recently changed into software development or another field
* Link to working projects and source code
* Be concise in summarizing past work experience
* Have a short resume. Try to fit on 1 page

## Grammar, Punctuation, and Spelling

* Spell out obscure abbreviations in full the first time you use them. The first letter of each word is typically not capitalized (e.g., use "scanning tunneling microscope (STM)" instead of "Scanning Tunneling Microscope (STM)").
* [Tips For Effective Proofreading](https://ualr.edu/writingcenter/tips-for-effective-proofreading/)
* Typos and poor grammar on a resume come across as not paying attention to detail. They can easily cause your resume to be ignored.  
* Do a grammar check, not just a spell check. This includes punctuation: only capitalize [proper nouns](https://www.grammarly.com/blog/proper-nouns/)
* Use free spell checking tools like [Grammarly](http://app.grammarly.com), [Hemingway Editor](http://hemingwayapp.com), [LanguageTool](https://languagetool.org/), and [Quillbot](https://quillbot.com/)
* Ask friends and family to proofread your resume. A fresh set of eyes never hurts.

## u/emnm47's How To Get A Job™ Speech

Networking is EVERYTHING (or at least a skewed amount) now that apps are online, and it's easy to use filters. You must network to have a chance, unless you're in the top 3% of candidates (those people can toss a resume in and get lots of bites). If you continue to throw applications out there without networking, it is highly unlikely you will get picked up. I will get more into networking later BUT here are some steps for How To Get A Job™:

**Step 1:** Evaluate your desperation level

* How much money do you have saved up?
* Do you have any dependents, loans, rent, debts, or food money concerns?
* Should you get a part-time job or file for unemployment while you continue to search?

**Step 2:** Set a timeline.

* For example: "If I haven't accepted a position by Jan 1st, I am changing x y, and z."
* Your timeline will rely on your desperation level. Feel free to break it up into tiers as your desperation increases and the timeline shortens.

**Steps 3-7:** What you can do to improve (aka the x y and z):

* Edit your resume (hey, you’re in the right place!)
* Up your networking game (see below)
* Revamp your LinkedIn profile
* Follow up on previous applications
* Refocus on a different job market, geographic area, or company size if needed

You can't blindly send off 100 applications online and wait to hear back. You have to use your network of friends, family, ex-coworkers, peers, professors, etc. to ask around for openings. While Aunt Lucy might not be an engineer, one of her girlfriends in spin class might be. Actually making contact with someone on “the other side” (engineer, manager, HR, hiring manager, etc.) is huge and will get your name in their head. Follow up after every application. You may feel like you're being annoying, but honestly, people forget, so following up a few times is not a bad thing.

It’s so easy now to just send off a resume to a position. A single opening could have 100 applicants, and maybe the top 10 get interviews and the top 3 get offers. This is great for those with spectacular resumes - you know the type, who interned at SpaceX, built prosthetics for puppies in their spare time, and tutored underprivileged kids in STEM on the weekends, all while getting stellar grades. These few people look amazing on paper and receive interest from all over the board.

Only a few people can draw interest from resumes alone. That’s when you need that name recognition and a willingness to pull your application and take a look at it. If you can get someone to actually look at it, you have a big advantage.
