### u/emnm47's How To Get A Job™ Speech

Networking is EVERYTHING (or at least a skewed amount) now that apps are online, and it's easy to use filters. You must network to have a chance, unless you're in the top 3% of candidates (those people can toss a resume in and get lots of bites). If you continue to throw applications out there without networking, it is highly unlikely you will get picked up. I will get more into networking later BUT here are some steps for How To Get A Job™:

---

**Step 1:** Evaluate your desperation level

- How much money do you have saved up?
- Do you have any dependents, loans, rent, debts, or food money concerns?
- Should you get a part-time job or file for unemployment while you continue to search?

---

**Step 2:** Set a timeline.

- For example: "If I haven't accepted a position by Jan 1st, I am changing x y, and z."
- Your timeline will rely on your desperation level. Feel free to break it up into tiers as your desperation increases and the timeline shortens.

---

**Steps 3-7:** What you can do to improve (aka the x y and z):

- Edit your resume (hey, you’re in the right place!)
- Up your networking game (see below)
- Revamp your LinkedIn profile
- Follow up on previous applications
- Refocus on a different job market, geographic area, or company size if needed

You can't blindly send off 100 applications online and wait to hear back. You have to use your network of friends, family, ex-coworkers, peers, professors, etc. to ask around for openings. While Aunt Lucy might not be an engineer, one of her girlfriends in spin class might be. Actually making contact with someone on “the other side” (engineer, manager, HR, hiring manager, etc.) is huge and will get your name in their head. Follow up after every application. You may feel like you're being annoying, but honestly, people forget, so following up a few times is not a bad thing.

It’s so easy now to just send off a resume to a position. A single opening could have 100 applicants, and maybe the top 10 get interviews and the top 3 get offers. This is great for those with spectacular resumes - you know the type, who interned at SpaceX, built prosthetics for puppies in their spare time, and tutored underprivileged kids in STEM on the weekends, all while getting stellar grades. These few people look amazing on paper and receive interest from all over the board.

Only a few people can draw interest from resumes alone. That’s when you need that name recognition and a willingness to pull your application and take a look at it. If you can get someone to actually look at it, you have a big advantage.
