1. **Do you have a photo on your resume?** Remove it.
2. **How many contact details and social profile links do you have on your resume?** You should have no more than four. Do you need all of these?
3. **Do all the links work on your resume?** Click through each of them.
4. **Do all the links point to professional pages on your resume?** When you click through, will people see well-formatted, well-written content that conveys the type of work they can expect from you? Ensure this is the case also for your blog, GitHub, LinkedIn and any other links you provide.
5. **Is your resume easy to scan?** Give your resume to a friend and ask them to take a look at it for 5 seconds, then tell you their immediate impression. Did they see key details? Did they think it’s too crowded? Or that it has too little information?
6. **Is your resume simple enough?** Are you using any “fancy” designs? If so, is this kind of “fanciness” getting in the way of readability? If it’s not in the way of readability, that’s great. However, if it’s making things harder to scan, consider going with something more simple. Note that for frontend, UX or design-heavy positions, some nice flair can be a great touch.
7. **Is the resume concise and to the point?** Are you using short sentences? Do you have bullet points with rarely more than two lines?
8. **Are you bolding too much?** Aim to not bold anything inside a sentence, like in this one. Only bold important things like job title, company name, date, or headers.
9. **Is formatting consistent?** Are you using standard font sizes, and aligning with tabs, over spacing things to be approximately close?
10. **Are you using internal company jargon?** Do you have project names that only people inside the company would understand? If so, consider changing them to describing the project.
11. **Do you have a (spoken) languages or a references section?** You can probably remove both of these.
12. **Do links stand out with a different color or formatting?** They shouldn’t. They take away space and attention.
