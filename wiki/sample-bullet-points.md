- Developed GD&T manufacturing requirements for a line of engine valves, saving $15,000 annually
- Drove root cause analysis and investigation efforts to present findings and corrective actions on any issues in weekly NPI reviews to leadership teams and key stakeholders to assess program stability and direction 
- Coordinated with cross-functional teams to collect and present historical data from previous programs to leverage against in field user data to de risk a 100% reliability test failure ahead of mass production

### Software

- Developed a back-end web service to handle user authentication using JWT and interacting with existing user services to store session data in Redis cache, leading to a 14% reduction in dropped session complaints
- Led the development of a data pipeline platform using Kafka streams, ingesting data from various data stores from across the application, resulting in a more streamlined developer experience for data query teams and reduced congestion by 24% during peak hours
- Developed a React Native-based mobile application by collaborating with product design teams, interacting with a GraphQL API allowing users to navigate and make orders to local restaurants
- Constructed and optimized distributed data scraping and processing pipelines leveraging Flume in Python and C++ to create
labeled image datasets used for model training and evaluation
- Wrote backend video processing (C++) and video playback rendering code (Java, JavaScript) to support optimized video
encoding/decoding which varied depending on operating system and platform and allowed for significant savings in video start
latency and size

### Civil/Environmental/Structural

- Managed the completion of the (major building in city) through collaboration with project managers, architects, and consultants, resulting in a timely and cost effective completion
- Optimized environmental efficiency for wastewater treatment in (city) by coordinating with operations and evaluating processes such as aeration, biosolids, digesters, and %energy
- Facilitated sanitary and stormwater servicing for hundreds of properties throughout (city) by engaging with municipal officers and subdivision planning, resulting in over 1,000 newly serviced properties in (year)
- Designed the structural integrity and components for (major structure such as a bridge) using AutoCAD, and Revit, and ensured the structure adhered to all safety and government regulations with material efficiency
- Developed over (number) Project Site Safety Plans for key projects throughout (city) by conducting safety training, assessing past lessons learned, and determining safety targets in compliance with OSHA standards


### Electrical -- Hardware

- Performed architecture study on potential LDO designs to use for next-generation ULP CMOS imaging products  
- Led effort to introduce and implement a new low-jitter 600 MHz oscillator architecture with 8x power saving over existing PLL-based implementations, and also eliminating the need for external oscillator references  
- Architected and designed a 5-uW unconditionally-stable capacitorless-LDO supporting up to 10mA of load current  
- Designed a nW-level time-to-digital (TDC) temperature sensor capable of sub-1â„ƒ resolution as measured in silicon  
- Drove circuit and system implementation of a small area current-mode front-end in order to prove ability of the new technology to sense a fingerprint (stepping-stone for fingerprint sensor cost reduction)
- Led the introduction of a new 1Gbps MIPI DSI receiver architecture to the, utilizing continuous-time linear equalization, to replace existing solution and proposed an integrated offset calibration scheme  

### Manufacturing
